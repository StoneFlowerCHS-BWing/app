                    Archimedes once said, “Give me firm place to stand upon and I can move the Earth”. This very platform was provided me by Ms. SARA. I take the opportunity to express my gratitude towards my Project coordinator for her constant encouragement and guidance. As the saying goes “No matter how big and small an endeavor is, nothing is done in vacuum! It is done because the supporting roles of many others”. The development of the project is result of the collective efforts along with the productive input of many of my teachers and colleagues. I am grateful to each one of them.
                    I am thoroughly indebted to IT Department to provided me wonderful opportunity to learn and practically implement all that I have studied during my project theory and helping me develop a systematic linear rational approach while dealing with project.
                    This acknowledgement is a small effort to express our gratitude to all those who have shown us the part to bring out various colors of this project with their vast treasures of experience and knowledge.
